    "# Part 2: Algorithms for the linear least squares problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the linear regression problem: given a data matrix, $X$, and responses $y$, we wish to determine the model parameters $\\theta^*$ that minimizes $\\|X \\theta - y\\|_2^2$. This problem is also known as the _linear least squares_ problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy has a function, [np.linalg.lstsq()](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.lstsq.html), that will compute linear least squares solutions for you. However, the purpose of this notebook is to give you a sense of how `lstsq()` works. So, instead of using it as a black box, you'll study how one might implement `lstsq()` using two different numerical algorithms.\n",

    "> You may rightly ask, why bother with such details? Here are three reasons it's worth looking more closely.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. It's helpful to have some deeper intuition for how one formalizes a mathematical problem and derives a computational solution, in case you ever encounter a problem that does not exactly fit what a canned library can do for you.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 2. If you have ever used a statistical analysis package, it's likely you have encountered \"strange\" numerical errors or warnings. Knowing how problems are derived can help you understand what might have gone wrong. We will see an example below.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3. Because data analysis is quickly evolving, it's likely that new problems and new models will not exactly fit the template of existing models. Therefore, it's possible you will need to derive a new model or know how to talk to someone who can derive one for you."

So, by forming $C$ explicitly and then trying to solve a system based on it, we make the problem _more_ difficult. Indeed, if the problem is ill-conditioned enough, this algorithm based on directly constructing the normal equations will produce very different results even under small changes, and we call the algorithm _unstable_.\n",

    "**Summary comment.** The intent of this notebook was to help you appreciate some of the reliability and performance issues involved in the design of numerical algorithms. The key ideas are as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The _conditioning_ of a problem, which is a measure of how hard it is to solve. For solving linear systems, the condition number of the matrix produced by `numpy.linalg.cond()` is this measure.\n",
    "2. For the specific problem of linear least squares, a method based on QR factorization is better than forming the Gram matrix, which squares the condition number. Although we did not discuss the theory of QR better, it exemplifies a common pattern or trick in linear algebraic problems: converting the original problem (or matrix) into one whose structure is easier to solve.\n",
    "3. There is a potential tradeoff between _reliability_ of an algorithm and _speed_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of these algorithmic and engineering ideas have already been worked out, and are encapsulated in Numpy's built-in [`lstsq()` solver](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.lstsq.html) or its [Scipy equivalent](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.lstsq.html). So when you need to solve a linear system in a future notebook, you can use this function."
