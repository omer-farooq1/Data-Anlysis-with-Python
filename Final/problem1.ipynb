When US-based companies want to hire highly skilled foreign professionals, they can petition the US government for a special type of visa for such workers to come or stay in the country. The data on which companies have submitted petitions, what base salaries they are proposing to pay such workers, and where the workers will work is publicly available. The H1B Visa Salary Database has aggregated this information from 2013-2019. While it applies to foreign workers only, we can still try to use it to get an idea of what kinds of jobs are available across various job categories and identify some possible trends.\n",
